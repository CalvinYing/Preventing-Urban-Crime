Final project for the course ORIE 4741 Learning with Big Messy Data offered at Cornell University

Course can be found here: https://people.orie.cornell.edu/mru8/orie4741/


Introduction
------------
We seek to understand the problem of crime using machine learning and create in- sights that can lead to simple solutions. Using machine learning we hope to answer questions such as:
* What is the relationship between crime and housing prices?
* How is crime related to things such as number of local parks, nearby schools and quality
of those schools?


Team members:

  * Jonathan Posada (jnp53)
